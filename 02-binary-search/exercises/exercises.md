## 1. Find the position of the target in a sorted array

Problem:
You are given a sorted array in ascending order (e.g., [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]) and a target number. Use Binary Search to find the index of the target in the array. If the target is not found, return -1.

**Example:**

```txt
Input: target = 7, array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
Output: 3 (the target 7 is at index 3)
```

## 2. Find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array

Problem:
You are given an array that was originally sorted in ascending order but has been rotated. For example, [6, 7, 9, 15, 19, 2, 3] is a rotated version of [2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 15, 19]. Use Binary Search to find the minimum element in the rotated array.

**Example:**

```txt
Input: array = [6, 7, 9, 15, 19, 2, 3] <br>
Output: 2 (the smallest element is 2)
```

## 3. Find the largest number less than or equal to the target

Problem:
Given a sorted array in ascending order, you need to find the largest number less than or equal to the target using Binary Search.

**Example:**

```txt
Input: target = 10, array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
Output: 9 (the largest number less than or equal to 10 is 9)
```
